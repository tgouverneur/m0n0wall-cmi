<a name="support"></a><h2>Where to get support from ?</h2>
<p>
If you need assistance with m0n0wall-CMI (not m0n0wall itself), you can use following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>First read the documentation, query mailling-list archive, etc..</li>
<li>Subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/m0n0wall-cmi-users">mailling-list</a> and write for support.</li>
</ul>

<a name="bug"></a><h2>I've found a bug, what should I do ?</h2>
<p>
If you have found a bug in m0n0wall-CMI, please either write to <i>m0n0wall-cmi-users</i> list or fill a bug report on sourceforge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=214530&atid=1030049">tracker</a>.
</p>


<a name="patch"></a><h2>I've found a bug and make a patch to correct it, what should I do ?</h2>
<p>
Best way if you have wrote a bug is to write on the mailling list m0n0wall-cmi-users and attach the patch file together with the bugreport.
</p>


<a name="contact"></a><h2>I've other question or request, where can I send them ?</h2>
<p>
Again, mailling-list is the best way. If you have a request or question that can't be posted on a public area, you can write directly to the <a href="mailto:thomas@gouverneur.name">author</a>. Please note that any request that is found not to be relevant or that could have been asked on the mailling-list is found in the author's mailbox, it will be redirected to <a href="http://127.0.0.1">/dev/null</a>.
